If we live to be 90 years old, write a program that informs us how many weeks we have left using math and f-Strings.

It will use your age as the input and output the remaining time in this format, along with your present age:

You are left with x weeks.

where x is the actual number of weeks that the input age has left till age 90, as computed.
